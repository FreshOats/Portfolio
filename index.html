                <p class="card-text">In my 15+ years of experience in quantitative data analysis, I have utilized statistical analysis in data-driven
                decision-making, collaborating in projects ranging from predictive text analytics to isolating neural impulse signals.
                My affinity for learning and receiving feedback is demonstrated in my 5+ years of continued education in advanced
                analytics with Python, R, SQL, MongoDB, Tableau among others, while also establishing a foundation in data science with
                machine learning, producing tidy data, and managing both structured and unstructured databases. As a graduate of the
                Data Science & Visualization Boot Camp at UC San Diego as well as the Johns Hopkins University Data Science
                Specialization with a Masterâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech and Emory University, I am always
                seeking to venture into the known and unknown to reveal the stories from the minutiae details in a sea of data. As a
                scientist and public speaker, I am always seeking to tell these stories to technical and non-technical audiences alike.</p>

                        The client is a foundation that has made over 34,000 charitable donations over the years, and they would like to try to
                        identify predictors of successful donations. To date, only 53.2% of the organizations that have received money from the
                        foundation have been successful. After completing this analysis, the highest accuracy achieved by deep
                        learning was 72.7% accuracy, wheras using Random Forests achieved a slightly higher 73.3% accuracy with a much lower
                        computational impact and processing time.

                    <p>
                        By accessing Amazon's review information collected on a certain category of products, we can ascertain whether there is
                        such a bias. The assumption is that there will be a higher percentage of 5-star ratings by the paid Vine users than of
                        the unpaid users. The findings of this study do not support that assumption, though it is to be noted that this study
                        only represents the data regarding Amazon's Pet Products.

                    <p>
                    As the unique number of crypocurrencies continues to rise, it is difficult to ascertain how each of them are related,
                    and whether the algorithm itself is even a good predictor of how each crypto can be classified. K-Means clusterding, is
                    applied here to perform unsupervised machine learning in the grouping of over 500 active currencies, as it is important to
                    know which cryptocurrencies are similar for potential crypto investors.

                        This project uses Leaflet to show earthquake data from the last 7 days, acquired from the USGS.gov website. The
                        earthquakes are plotted showing the magnitued by color and size of the marker, along with presenting the location and
                        magnitude upon clicking. While it was expected that most earthquakes would be along such lines, there were
                        two places in the world where earthquakes occurred nowhere near such tectonic divisions.

                        This project uses web scraping to gather facts about Mars with the most up-to-date information from NASA, and store the text and images in a NoSQL database.                 
                        The user can interact with the page to scrape NASA's website and update any headlines and the image-of-the-day.

                        This project extracts data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle to create clean data sets for a hack-a-thon for Amazing Prime.
                        The wikipedia data was acquired in json form, while the Kaggle data was downloaded as a file with several csv files. The
                        tables were inspected during exploratory data analysis, and then subsequently cleaned using Python. Following data
                        cleaning, the tables were merged and uploaded to a PostgreSQL server for the hack-a-thon.

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this analyis was to analyze the data provided by PyBer to make decisions based on city size for how to
                        increase net fares, and thus profits, for the company. Using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy the data were
                        cleaned, evaluated, and then plotted to show the total fare trends by region over time. To do this required merging two
                        dataframes, then grouping the cities by type to determine the total rides, total drivers, total fares, fares per ride,
                        and fares per driver. Next, the data were reorganized in a pivot table, time data reformatted, and finally plotted as a
                        line chart, showing the total fares over time for the 3 city sizes.

                    <h2>World Weather Analysis</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project uses the OpenWeatherApp API and Google Maps API to find random locations on the globe, then show the
                        nearest hotels to plan a vacation based on temperature constraints. In this analysis, the input temperature range was 0
                        degrees to 48 degrees as a maximum temperature. During the summer, it seems like a great time to escape from the heat
                        and visit some of the coldest places that have hotels! To do this, a heatmap layer was added to the map and the
                        nearest_cities search was applied, and subsequently only cities with hotels were kept. After finding the worldwide
                        locations, 4 locations were chosen within driving distance of one another. These locations were shown with the a travel
                        route and then with the pertinent information for the traveler, such as the city and weather.

                    <p>
                        The purpose of the project is to reduce the processing speed by refactoring the code that used a nested for loop. While
                        the processing time for the nested loops weren't terrible, they were only analyzing 12 different tickers. Increasing the
                        number of tickers to hundreds would seriously impact the speed and resources required to count everything within a
                        nested loop. The code was therefore refactored to use a single loop with conditional statements within to determine when
                        to change to a different ticker.
